El objetivo del juego es descubrir las 10 parejas distintas, quedando todas las cartas boca arriba en la menor cantidad de intentos posibles.<br><br>La temática del juego está relacionada a las inundaciones, y las figuras del tablero representan acciones a tomar en caso de que se produzcan inundaciones. Cada vez que el jugador descubre una pareja de figuras, se muestra un mensaje que describe la figura y enseña al jugador que recaudos debe tomar en caso de que se produzcan inundaciones.<br><br>Para reiniciar el juego, contamos con el botón \"Volver a jugar\".',\n\t        imageUrl: 'img/ayuda.png',\n\t        confirmButtonText: 'Entendido'\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t  }]);\n\t\n\t  return App;\n\t}(_react.Component);\n\t\n\texports.default = App;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 172 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(18);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\t__webpack_require__(178);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\t\n\tfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?

El jugador en cada turno voltéa dos cartas y si ambas figuras coinciden, quedan boca arriba. En caso contrario ambas cartas se vuelven a voltear. El objetivo del juego es descubrir las 10 parejas distintas, quedando todas las cartas boca arriba en la menor cantidad de intentos posibles.<br><br>La temática del juego está relacionada a las inundaciones, y las figuras del tablero representan acciones a tomar en caso de que se produzcan inundaciones.
